=============================== WHAT IS PYTHON ==============================
Python is the world's fasted growing programming language

It is a multi-purpose language

Uses include: data analysis, machine learning, apps

Very simple syntax, 
	so you can write complex programs with fewer lines of code

It's also a very high-level language, reads like the english language. Do not have to do memory management.
	- High-level languages are easy to for humans to interpret, low-level interect more directly with the machine

================================ HELLO WORLD ================================

create a file 
	first.py 

type
	print("hello world")

in the command line, run
	python first.py

The output should read:
	'hello world'

Congrats! You've written your first program!


============================ PYTHON COMMAND LINE ============================

Type into the command line:
	python 

from there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:
	C:\Users\Your Name>python
	Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
	Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
	>>> print("Hello, World!")

Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:
	exit()
or hit ctrl-c
