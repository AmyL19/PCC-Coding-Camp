#==============================  PYTHON VARIABLES  ============================

# VARIABLES are containers for storing data values.

x = 5 # x is the name of this variable, and 5 is the value that it holds
y = "hippo"
print(x)
print(y)



#==============================  VARIABLE NAMES  ==============================

# A few rules for Python variable names:
# - a variable must start with a letter or underscore (cannot start with a number)
# - a variable can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
# - variable names are case-sensitive

# Which of the following are legal variable names?
myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
2myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
my var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"



#==============================  VARIABLE TYPES  ==============================

# Variables that store different kinds of values have different TYPES.
# The type of a variable can be changed after the variable has been set.

x = 4 # What is the type of x?
x = "peachy" # Now what is the type of x?



#==============================  DISPLAYING VARIABLES  ========================

# One way to output the value of a variable is to use a PRINT statement
# print() is a builtin Python function that 
	# -> takes in a variable or value and
	# <- prints it out to the console

print("Hello World")
x = "Hello World"
print(x)
