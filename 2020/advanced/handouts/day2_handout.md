## Loops

A for loop repeats an action a specific number of times
based on the provided range

range(x,y) includes x but excludes y
range(x) == range(0,x)

If you don't need a loop, don't use a loop

## Nested for loops

Loops inside of loops - think of a grid/cooridnate plane

## While loops

Similar to for loops, but in order to stop looping, the condition
must be broken

## Functions

A function is a way to package code that you repeat a lot
